This repository contains (code will be added in a couple of hours)
the implementation of an approach that detects faults in Puppet programs including
missing ordering relationships and missing notifiers.
The full decription of this framework will appear at the
[International Conference of Software Enginerring](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2020/).
